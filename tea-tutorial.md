# Beginners Tutorial for Making Tea

Making tea can be very simple! To brew your very first tea, you only need:

- tea  
- water
- a kettle
- a clean mug

## Tea
You will typically find tea sold in two different ways: loose leaf, and prepackaged tea bags. 

### Loose leaf
This tea is sold "loose" (i.e. not in a prepackaged tea bag). Loose leaf tea is a great option if you want to customize your tea's stength and flavour. 

Since this tea is sold "loose", you'll need a way to prevent the physical tea leaves or "chunks" from getting into your finished tea. This is usually done with an tea infuser or a small mesh strainer. The infuser or strainer will sit in the boiled water in your mug. These are typically very inexpensive and are reusable.

### Prepackaged tea bags
A common tea option is to purchase prepackaged tea bags. These teas come in different flavours, and the tea bags themselves are usually compostable. 

You do not need an infuser/strainer if you use prepackaged tea.

## Making your tea
Before you begin, you should read the instructions for your tea to know how hot your water should be, and how long you should steep your tea (i.e. how long your physical tea should sit in your boiled water).

Note: If you're unsure how hot your water should be, a common method is to boil your water in a kettle, then just let it cool in the kettle for about a minute before you pour it into your mug. This works fine for most tea.

1. Boil your water. The best and easiest way to boil your water is with an electric or stovetop kettle.

2. While your water is boiling, prepare your tea.

    - If you're using loose leaf tea, prepare it in a mesh infuser/strainer and place that in your mug

    - If you're using prepacked tea bags, open the package and place the tea bag in your mug

3. Carefully pour the boiled water into your mug

4. Steep your tea i.e. leave the tea in the water for as long as the directions say. If you like your tea stronger, you can leave it in the water for a bit longer than the directions call for    

5. Take the tea out

6. Optional: add milk, cream, sugar, honey, etc.

7. Wait until your tea is cool enough to drink. This can take some time if you're drinking your tea black

### Different types of tea
The great thing about tea is all of the different options available! You can get caffeine free tea, specially flavoured tea, etc.

Some common tea types:
- herbal
- black
- peppermint
