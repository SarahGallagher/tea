# Beginners Tutorial for Making Tea

Making tea can be very simple! To brew your very first tea, you only need:

- tea  
- water
- a kettle
- a clean mug

## Tea
Tea is made from dried tea leaves. When you soak-- or "steep"-- tea leaves in hot water, you infuse your water with the flavour from the tea leaves. It is a very popular, inexpensive drink that can be drank hot or cold. 

You will typically find tea sold in two different ways: loose leaf, and prepackaged tea bags. 

### Loose leaf
This tea is sold "loose" (i.e. not in a prepackaged tea bag). Loose leaf tea is a great option if you want to customize your tea's stength and flavour. 

Since this tea is sold "loose", you'll need a way to prevent the physical tea leaves from getting into your finished tea. This is usually done with an tea infuser or a small mesh strainer. These are typically very inexpensive and reusable.

### Prepackaged tea bags
A common way to purchase tea is in prepackaged tea bags. These teas come in different flavours, and the tea bags themselves are usually compostable. 

You do not need an infuser/strainer if you use prepackaged tea bags.

## Making your tea
Before you begin, you should read the instructions for your tea to know how hot your water should be and how long you should steep your tea (i.e. how long your physical tea should sit in your boiled water).

Note: If you're unsure how hot your water should be, a common method is to just boil your water in a kettle, then let it cool in the kettle for about 1-3 minutes before you pour it into your mug. This will work fine for most tea.

1. Boil your water in an electic or stovetop kettle.

2. While your water is boiling, prepare your tea.

    - If you're using loose leaf tea, prepare it in a mesh infuser/strainer and place that in your mug

    - If you're using a prepacked tea bag, open the package and place the tea bag in your mug

3. Carefully pour the boiled water into your mug

4. Steep your tea (i.e. leave the tea in the water) for as long as the directions call for. Depending on how strong you like your tea, you can steep your tea for slightly longer, or shorter, then the directions call for. 
    - Note: depending on the quality and type of tea you're using, your tea may taste bitter if you steep it for too long.

5. Take the tea infuser, or tea bag, out of your mug.

6. Optional: if you don't want to drink your tea black, you can add some additional ingredients. Common additions are milk, cream, sugar, or honey. 

7. Wait until your tea is cool enough to drink.If you'd prefer your tea cold, you can refridgerate or place ice cubes in your tea to cool it down. Note that placing ice cubes in your tea may dilute the flavour.
