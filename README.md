# Beginner's Tutorial for Making Tea

Making tea can be very simple! To brew your very first tea, you'll only need:

- tea  
- water
- a kettle
- a clean mug

## What is tea?
Tea is made from dried tea leaves. When you soak-- or "steep"-- tea leaves in hot water, you infuse your water with the flavour from the tea leaves. It is a very popular, inexpensive drink that can be enjoyed hot or cold. 

>Tea can contain caffeine. You should always read the packaging if you are caffeine sensitive.

You will usually find tea sold in two different ways: loose leaf, and prepackaged tea bags. 

### Loose leaf
This tea is sold "loose" (i.e. not in prepackaged bags). Loose leaf tea is a great option if you want to customize your tea's strength and flavour. 

Since this tea is sold "loose", you'll need a way to prevent the physical tea leaves or particles from getting into your finished drink. This is usually done with an tea infuser, or a small mesh strainer. These are typically inexpensive and reusable. You can also purchase mugs with built in infusers. 

### Prepackaged tea bags
A common way to purchase tea is in prepackaged tea bags. These teas come in different flavours, and the tea bags themselves are usually compostable. 

You do not need an infuser/strainer if you use prepackaged tea bags.

## Making your tea
Before you begin, you should read the instructions for your tea to know how hot your water should be and how long you should steep your tea for (i.e. how long your tea bag or infuser should sit in your boiled water).

>If you're unsure how hot your water should be, a common method is to boil your water in a kettle, then let it cool in the kettle for about 1-3 minutes before you pour it into your mug. This will work fine for most tea.


1. Boil your water in an electric or stove-top kettle.

2. While your water is boiling, prepare your tea.

    - If you're using loose leaf tea, measure it out into your mesh infuser or strainer and place that in your mug

    - If you're using a prepacked tea bag, open the package and place the tea bag in your mug

3. Carefully pour the boiled water into your mug.

4. Steep your tea (i.e. leave the tea in the water) for as long as the directions call for.

5. Take the tea infuser, or tea bag, out of your mug. You can compost the tea leaves. If you used a tea bag, you can usually compost the entire bag (remove any staples or non-compostable parts first). 

6. Optional: if you don't want to drink your tea black, you can add some additional ingredients. Common additions are milk, cream, sugar, or honey. 

7. Wait until your tea is cool enough to drink. If you'd prefer your tea cold, you can refrigerate it, or, you can add ice cubes to your steeped tea to cool it down. Note that placing ice cubes in your tea may dilute the flavour. 

## Types of tea
Though most tea comes from the same plant, the type of tea is determined by what part of the plant is used and how it's processed. 

You can typically determine the type of tea by looking it's steeped colour. Common tea types are:
- black
- white
- green

You'll also see different blends and flavours of tea. Common ones are:
- herbal 
- earl grey
- mint
- chai or spice
- fruity blends
